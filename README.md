Title: Face Recognition with OpenCV & Python

Description:
A real-time face recognition system using Python, OpenCV, and the face_recognition library. This project detects and identifies faces from a webcam feed, matching them against a preloaded set of known faces. It also calculates a confidence score for each recognized face.


Features:
✅ Detects and recognizes faces from live video.
✅ Uses face_recognition for encoding and matching faces.
✅ Supports storing known faces in the faces/ directory.
✅ Displays real-time annotations with name and confidence score.
✅ Press 'Q' to exit the program.

Tech Stack:


Python
OpenCV (for video processing & drawing annotations)
face_recognition (for face encoding & matching)
NumPy (for numerical operations)
